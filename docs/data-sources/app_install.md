# snyk_app_install (Data Source)

The app install data source provides information about an existing app installation.

Snyk Apps are the modern and preferred way to build integrations with Snyk,
exposing fine-grained scopes for accessing resources over the Snyk APIs,
powered by OAuth 2.0 for a developer-friendly experience. See (Snyk Apps)[https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/using-specific-snyk-apis/snyk-apps-apis].

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "snyk_app_install" "unicorn" {
  organization_id = data.snyk_organization.frontend.id

  # Search criteria to find the app installation. At least one of
  # the following must be provided. Combining multiple attributes
  # makes the search more specific. For example, providing both
  # `id` and `app_name` will ensure that the app installation with
  # the given `id` also has the correct name, preventing potential mismatches.
  id       = "<app-install-id>"
  app_id   = "<app-id>"
  app_name = "<app-name>"
}

data "snyk_organization" "frontend" {
  name = "Frontend Team"
}
```
