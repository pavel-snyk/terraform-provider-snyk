# snyk_broker_deployment (Resource)

The broker deployment resource allows to manage Snyk broker deployments.

A Snyk broker deployment is the recommended way to manage Snyk Universal Broker. It allows you
to group broker connections into separate deployments for better organization and management.
For more information, see [Universal Broker documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/universal-broker).

!> This resource requires **Snyk Tenant admin** permissions. Ensure the token configured in the provider block belongs to a user with this permission level.

## Example Usage

### Basic

```terraform
resource "snyk_broker_deployment" "dev" {
  app_install_id  = "<app-install-id>"
  organization_id = "<organization-id>"
  tenant_id       = "<tenant-id>"

  metadata = {
    env     = "dev"
    name    = "deployment for frontend team on staging cluster"
    comment = "managed by terraform"
  }
}

output "broker_deployment_id" {
  value = snyk_broker_deployment.dev.id
}
```

### Without organization ID

```terraform
# The "organization_id" attribute is optional but recommended
# for faster performance. If omitted, the provider searches all
# accessible organizations to locate the Universal Broker
# App installation, which will increase creation time.
resource "snyk_broker_deployment" "dev" {
  app_install_id = "<app-install-id>"
  tenant_id      = "<tenant-id>"
}
```
