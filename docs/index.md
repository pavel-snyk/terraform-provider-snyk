# Snyk Provider

-> The provider is in **technical preview** and not ready for production usage.

Use the Snyk provider to interact with the resources supported by Snyk.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before
it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 1.0.7 and later:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    snyk = {
      source  = "pavel-snyk/snyk"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Set the variable value in *.tfvars file
# or using -var="snyk_token=..." CLI option
variable "snyk_token" {}

# Configure the Snyk Provider
provider "snyk" {
  token = var.snyk_token
}
```
